        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nigerian fried rice looks, feels, and eats like a dish that’s a cross between Indian pilau and Chinese fried rice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups converted rice (13 1/4 ounces; 375 g), such as Uncle Ben's Original or golden sella basmati</li>
                <li>3 1/2 cups (825 ml) Nigerian-style stock, divided, plus more as needed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (30 ml) virgin coconut oil or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 medium carrot (2 3/4 ounces; 75 g), cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
                <li>1 small red or white onion (2 1/4 ounces; 60 g), cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
                <li>1 1/2 ounces (45 g) green beans, stem ends trimmed and cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>2 scallions, ends trimmed, white and green parts separated, and each thinly sliced crosswise, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 large red bell pepper (2 3/4 ounces; 75 g), stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
                <li>1/2 medium green bell pepper (2 1/4 ounces; 60 g), stemmed, seeded, cut into 1/4-inch dice, divided</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (60 g) drained canned whole kernel sweet corn</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Nigerian-style curry powder (see note)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) full-fat coconut milk</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, cover rice by 2 inches of cool water. Using your hands, vigorously swish rice until water turns cloudy, about 30 seconds. Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain the rice, discarding the cloudy soaking water. Refill the bowl with cool water, and repeat rinsing and draining process until rinsing water runs clear. Transfer drained rice to a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Add 2 1/2 cups stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in drained rice. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to a very gentle simmer. Cover and cook until stock is absorbed and rice is half cooked, about 10 minutes. Transfer rice to a rimmed baking sheet, spread into an even layer, and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Using a fork, fluff rice to separate grains and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, onion, and green beans, season with salt, and cook until vegetables are coated in oil and shiny, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add sliced scallion whites, red bell pepper, half of the green pepper, and corn. Cook vegetables until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in curry powder, thyme, black pepper, and bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Add half-cooked rice and stir gently to combine. Add coconut milk and remaining 1 cup stock. Return to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until rice is cooked through, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If rice is too dry and grains are not soft or cooked through, add stock in 1/4 cup increments, and continue to cook, covered, until rice is soft and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Stir in sliced scallion greens and remaining green bell pepper, cover, and cook until pepper brightens and softens slightly, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
